1. First, I'll identify any new functions or methods added to the source file
2. Then I'll locate or create the corresponding test file (either .test.ts or .spec.ts in the same directory)
3. I'll generate appropriate test cases for the new functions/methods
4. I'll ensure the tests follow the project's existing testing patterns and conventions

Here are my suggested test updates based on your changes:"
